

**Recognition-based methods** - methods that learn to identify a particular class (e.g. the majority class or the minority class) (particularly vs. those which learn to *discriminate* between classes).

**Boundary-focused resampling** - resampling methods that seek to give more importance to those examples which are near the classification boundary, typically giving preference to preserving those examples over examples which are far from the boundary.

**Balanced imbalance** - imbalanced data where the imbalances are in some way uniformly distributed or simplistic, particularly in contrast with *imbalanced imbalance* where data can have sub-clusters within each class and those sub clusters may have unique properties or characteristics.

**Imbalanced imbalance** - see *balanced imbalance*.

**Directed resampling** - resampling methods in which the choice of samples to replace is informed rather than purely random [kotsiantis2006handling]
